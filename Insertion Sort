# Insertion sort
# Benneth Chibueze 
"""
Insertion sort works by using two loops, one inner and one outer.
the outer loop loops through the entire length of the array, N, once
but it starts from the second character on the list, leaving the first one ambigous
The header of this first loop actually seperates the "sorted" from the "unsorted"
"sorted" cos the list is only as sorted as till the position of the header
the inner loop compares the current item, arr[i] to the one directly beside it, to the left
if it is less than it, it is replaced by the left item but not before being stored in a temp variable
then it goes down the list to keep doing the same thing until it finds a spot to fit in, 
then it replaces the item at that spot

arr = [3,1,5,4,2]

def InsertSort(arr):
  N = len(arr) # Length of array
  for item in range(1, N):
    temp = arr[item]
    left = item - 1
    while arr[left] > temp and left >= 0:
      arr[left+1] = arr[left] # item at left replaces the item right beside it
      left -= 1 # move down the list
    arr[left+1] = temp # place the item being compared beside the lesser left
  
  return arr
      
    
  
print(InsertSort(arr))
