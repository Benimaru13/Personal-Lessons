# Sorting Algorithms - The Bubble Sort

"""
I just read up the main idea and concept behind one of the simplest sorting
algorithms out there; the Bubble Sort. It was easy enough to grasp and code 
and I was able to get it running with no issues.
Basic Idea:
create two loops:
-an outer loop to iterate through n times
-an inner loop to iterate through the list of size len(original)-1 
this is because of that's what the size would be when you pair up the neighbours

The inner loop swaps when its neighbour is smaller than it, and it does so by
assigning one value to a temporary value, overwriting that value, and then assinging the temporary
value to the other."""

test_arr = [2,3,1,1,5,4,5,7,8,1]

def BubbleSort(arr):
    len_arr = len(arr)
    for n in range(len_arr):
        temp = -1
        for i in range(len_arr - 1):
            if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
                temp = arr[i]
                arr[i] = arr[i+1]
                arr[i+1] = temp
                
    return arr

# OR
def BSort(arr):
  N = len(arr)
  for i in range(N):
    temp = -1
    for j in range(N-1):
      if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
        temp, arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j], arr[j+1], arr[j]
    
  return arr
      
print(BubbleSort(test_arr))
